To read first to get the right mind set (German):http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj77ZnzuYnYAhVDyqQKHf-jC2QQFgg1MAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bfe.admin.ch%2Fphp%2Fmodules%2Fpublikationen%2Fstream.php%3Fextlang%3Dde%26name%3Dde_512886920.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1JI_7GOP2WQnTsSbrSDFgh

We want to reduce the cost for the BMS or have a bigger System.

Current project idea is to have the 2lbms for a public swimming pool project:
Solar panels generating the power, Swimming pool uses this power, batteries needed for overnight in summertime and over month in winter. Summer duration / swimmingpool open 4.5 month - power for about 60 households needed - and in winter swimmingpool close for 7.5 month - power for about 3 households needed.

#Wrong goings from other projects:
deep deloading(snow), battery cell replacement takes took longer than expected, a malfunction with the battery control program and temporary communication errors with the battery control system, communication lags required load curtailment
