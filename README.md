Read first - to get the right mind set (German): http://www.bfe.admin.ch/php/modules/publikationen/stream.php?extlang=de&name=de_512886920.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1JI_7GOP2WQnTsSbrSDFgh

We want to reduce the cost for the BMS or have a bigger System.

Current project idea is to have the 2lbms for a public outdoor swimming pool open in summertimes.
Solar panels generating the power, Swimming pool uses this power, batteries needed for overnight in summertime and over month in winter. Summer duration / swimmingpool open 4.5 month - power for about 60 households needed - and in winter swimmingpool close for 7.5 month - power for about 3 households needed.

#Wrong goings from other projects:
deep deloading(snow), battery cell replacement takes took longer than expected, a malfunction with the battery control program and temporary communication errors with the battery control system, communication lags required load curtailment
