Abbreviations list used and possible explained

BMS - Battery Management System

SoC - State of charge
SoH - State of health
SoF - State of function

RC  - Rated Capacity, Capacity of new Battery or Empty portion + stored Energy + inactive 
      Battery consists of: empty portion that can be recharged, the stored energy and
      the inactive portion that is permanently lost due to aging.

SMBus - System Management Bus
CAN - Controller Area Network
LIN - Local Interconnect Network

EBM - electronic battery monitor - measuring voltage, current and temperature to estimate state-of-charge and detect anomalies. 
      e.g: in a small housing forming part of the positive battery clamp.

Solar
FCVT - full-charge voltage thresholds
MPPT - maximum power point tracking (solar cell at varying sunlight)
P&O - perturb and observe -  can be sluggish and result in oscillations -  
CS - Current sweep is a method that observes the current and voltage characteristics of the PV array to calculate
      the maximum power point.
